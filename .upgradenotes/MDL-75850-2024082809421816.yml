      type: improved
    - message: >
        A new `$notify` paramter has been added to the following methods in the `\core_files\file_storage` class:
          - `::create_file_from_storedfile()`
          - `::create_file_from_pathname()`
          - `::create_file_from_string()`
          - `::create_file()`

          When true, it will trigger the `after_file_created` hook to re-create the image.
